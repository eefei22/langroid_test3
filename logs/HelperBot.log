incredibly painful, even when you know it might be for the best. It’s okay to feel whatever you’re feeling right now, whether it’s sadness, anger, confusion, or all of the above.  

Here are a few things that might help:  
[1;36m1[0m. **Let yourself grieve**. There’s no “right” way to process a breakup. Cry, vent, or just sit with your feelings. They’re valid.  
[1;36m2[0m. **Lean on your people**. Talk to friends or family who care about you—you don’t have to go through this alone.  
[1;36m3[0m. **Take it one day at a time**. Healing isn’t linear. Some days will be harder than others, and that’s normal.  
[1;36m4[0m. **Rediscover yourself**. Reconnect with hobbies, goals, or things that make *you* happy outside of the relationship.  
[1;36m5[0m. **Delete or mute reminders if it helps**. You don’t need to torture yourself with old photos or texts while you heal.  

And remember: Your worth isn’t defined by this relationship or how it ended. You’re allowed to miss someone *and* still grow forward.  

If you want to talk more—about him, the breakup, or just a distraction—I’m here. Sending you so much warmth. 💛[1m[[0m[35m/[0m[95mgreen[0m[1m][0m
